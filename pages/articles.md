### [Retrieval-Augmented Generation as a Capability Multiplier for Research Tasks](articles/rag_as_a_capability_multiplier.md) (2026)

By Dominik Gorecki

Two controlled experiments show that using RAG significantly improves research outputs on **overall_score** plus **4 of 5** quality dimensions (factual correctness, completeness, hallucination risk, and academic response), with **coherence** the only metric that doesn’t reliably change. Crucially, **Gemini 3 Flash with RAG outperforms Gemini 3 Pro without RAG**, suggesting retrieval can substitute for model scale in research workflows, at the cost of longer, denser, less readable writing.


### [The Dose-Response Curve of RAG: More Context Yields Diminishing Returns](articles/dose_response_curve_for_RAG__wp.md) (2025)

By Domink Gorecki

An empirical investigation into the relationship between retrieval volume and response quality in RAG systems. The study demonstrates that while RAG significantly improves academic depth and completeness, it exhibits steep diminishing returns beyond 10-15 sources, with marginal gains dropping by 12x at higher volumes.
