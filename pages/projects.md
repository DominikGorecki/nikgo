VulcanLab is a research and knowledge assistant that lets you query your own library—papers, textbooks, notes, internal docs, and curated resources—through a normal chat workflow. Instead of producing “generic chatbot” answers, VulcanLab retrieves the most relevant passages from your materials and uses them to generate structured, high-signal responses that stay anchored to what you trust.
