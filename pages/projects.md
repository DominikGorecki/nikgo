# Projects 

**[VulcLab.com](https://vulclab.com)** - RAG Academic/Business (deep) Research over your documents.

> *VulcanLab is a research and knowledge assistant that lets you query your own library—papers, textbooks, notes, internal docs, and curated resources—through a normal chat workflow. Instead of producing “generic chatbot” answers, VulcanLab retrieves the most relevant passages from your materials and uses them to generate structured, high-signal responses that stay anchored to what you trust.*

## Old Projects

**[Fuzzy Faves - Chrome Plugin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fuzzy-faves/afdjpalpgemjpaipfihjpnnonneapljc)** - A chrome plugin to save links and search for them quickly. 

> *Save page links, make notes, and search them. It increases your productivity by having a single place where you can search added links. For example, if you're working on a project, you can add all the links related to that project and ad a note, "MyProject." Then when you want to see all the links related to that project, you just search, "MyProject." Fuzzy Faves will search the title, url, and notes, which are all customizable in the "Manage Links" page.*

**[Searchable Stream Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AiKismet.SearchableStream)** - A System.IO.Stream wrapper that adds some useful search and read abilities.

> *Default encoding for SearchableStringStream is ASCII. You can set a different encoding type in the constructor ``new SearchableStringStream(Stream stream, Encoding encoding)```. As an example, if you have a pdf (strings are usually ASCII encoded) you might want to first find the "trailer" of the file that's indicated by that as a string in the Byte data. The code below finds the last position of "trailer" and then renders three lines of that trailer.*

**[Slug Generator Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IoRecipes.SlugGenerator)** - Useful for generating unique slugs to use in a URL.
