# Dominik Gorecki

I’m Dominik, a Director of Engineering focused on building reliable systems, strong teams, and products that ship. My work spans .NET/C# backend architecture, React/TypeScript frontends, and Python/Go for automation and applied AI. Lately, I’ve been building retrieval-augmented (RAG) pipelines, developer tools, and knowledge systems that turn messy information into usable intelligence—because the real advantage isn’t “more data,” it’s better thinking. I’m especially drawn to the overlap between engineering and cognition: how humans reason, where we fool ourselves, and how to build tools that make decision-making clearer.

## Skills & Focus

**Engineering & Leadership**

* Engineering strategy, execution, and team building
* Product-minded delivery: scope discipline, iterative shipping, measurable outcomes
* Architecture that scales: maintainability first, complexity only when earned

**Technical Strengths**

* Backend: **C# / .NET**, APIs, distributed systems patterns, data modeling
* Frontend: **React / TypeScript**, UX-driven implementation, component systems
* Tooling/AI: **Python**, LangChain, automation, **RAG pipelines**, evaluation and quality control
* DevOps/Infra: cloud-first pragmatism (and local-first when it’s smarter), containers, CI/CD

**Interests**

* Cognitive science, psychology, rationality, learning systems
* Knowledge management, research tooling, “truth-preserving” workflows
